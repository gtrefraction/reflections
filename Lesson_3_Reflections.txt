When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Working collaboratively will be much easier with a remote repository. It also serves as a free backup.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a github specific command, that performs a clone on github which references the original repo. Branches are different from clones in that they are extensions to the repo for trying differnt things.
The remote is only included in the GIT status command if the -u upstream association is completed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare differences offline while developing new ideas.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I could meet up with friends. Email saved versions. It would be harder to find ways to merge differences, but you don't have to learn git syntax.
