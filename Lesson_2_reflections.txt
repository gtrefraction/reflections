When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created which tracks the metadata for your repository.
This will allow me to track revisions by committing changes.
The staging area is a type of limbo before changes get committed to the repository. The working directory always contains the latest files, unless a commit has been checked out.
The staging area can be used to ensure one logical commit by using the git diff --staged command
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be usefull for experiments and project specific deviations for tools. Each project could create a branch then merge the universal features.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
We added the differences from one branch to the other. I didn't see the diagram.
