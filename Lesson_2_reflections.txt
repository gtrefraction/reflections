When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created which tracks the metadata for your repository.
This will allow me to track revisions by committing changes.
The staging area is a type of limbo before changes get committed to the repository. The working directory always contains the latest files, unless a commit has been checked out.
The staging area can be used to ensure one logical commit by using the git diff --staged command
